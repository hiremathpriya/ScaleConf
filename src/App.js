  I have been one of the lucky one who got the chance to go to ScaleConf which was held on 11th of August here in Wellington.

  As much as I was looking forward to attend my first ever tech conference, I was also looking forward to  hear from  some of the smartest people from around  the world. 
  At last the day arrived, and i landed in Te Papa there were beautiful team of volunteers waiting to welcome you and register with some small goodies to give away.
   Morning started with Introduction speech by lovely host Mr..””
  He was the perfect host for the day with his excellent humour and knowledge,  day started with small introduction speech and we were sent to sit  in one of the halls in Te papa.
  There was long list of speakers  line up, I was very curious to listen to 1) google guy
  2)the girl from twitter
  3. Man from AWs
  4. Trade me guy
  5. Blockchain person
  All of the speakers were great in there own field.
   Some of the topics were easy to understand and some them were totally new but felt like I have added lot of knowledge in to my Brain in the whole day.
  My particular favourite was the speech from google guy.
  
  Also it was bit of a shame  that  we had to miss twiiter girl ,she could not make it because of some visa issue. Wished only she could record her speech and send it through you tube or something.
   On the day the food was delicious there were good mix of choices for veg. Vegan and others. 
  My fav was Lunch menu with three different types of salads and  afternoon tea with Pastrami with melted cheese with croissant.
  
  I think knowledge I added was learning about AWS, Data storage, Jenkins, automation testing, traversey, Devops vs R, whats the big fuss about blockchain and what does even it means also Learned about
